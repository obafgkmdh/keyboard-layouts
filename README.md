# Keyboard Layout Scripts

This repository hosts scripts that I have written for analyzing and generating keyboard layouts. Currently, this repository contains:
- `generate.cpp`: A utility for generating all keyboard layouts that are below a certain same-finger bigram (SFB) percentage and a same-finger skipgram (SFS) percentage.
- `postprocess.py`: A script that prints the output of `generate.cpp` in human-readable form.
